- [ ] Add ability to render in Canvas for speed, and only output SVG when needed. See: https://github.com/zenozeng/p5.js-svg/issues/257
- [ ] To do this, the random numbers need to be created in an init function so they can be consistent for both the SVG and Canvas renderings.
- [ ] Try George's new v2 of generative tools: npm install git+https://github.com/georgedoescode/generative-utils.git#v2
