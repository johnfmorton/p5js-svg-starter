# P5js SVG Starter Kit

This project, a WIP, is meant to be a starter kit for working with generative art that will output as an SVG file.

If the art is meant to be used on a pen plotter, the SVG creations would need to use only lines. Fills will not render on a pen plotter.

## Getting Started

This project uses [p5.js-svg](https://github.com/zenozeng/p5.js-svg) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

At the time of writing, the p5.js-svg library official version, v1.5.1, is not compatible with the current version of p5.js, 1.9.4. The library has been updated to work with the current version of p5.js, but the official version has not been updated. This updated version of is [https://github.com/johnfmorton/p5.js-svg](https://github.com/johnfmorton/p5.js-svg). Once the official version is updated, this project will be updated to use the official version.
